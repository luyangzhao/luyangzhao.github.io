Hi, this is Luyang, a 4th year Phd student from Dartmouth College in Computer Science. My current research spans a range of different topics in Motion Planning, Soft robots, Multi-robot systems, SLAM and Machine Learning. I am recently investigating designing and analyzing Soft lattice modules that behave independently and collectively. I did research on localization, path planning and navigation for Amazon autonomous mobility robots during Summer 2020. Moreover, I have worked on designing, building and evaluating memory-efficient data structure for summarizing costs of crossing local regions to find the optimal paths. I also worked on developing an assistive device for memory loss people and did some related research on SLAM with object detection.
