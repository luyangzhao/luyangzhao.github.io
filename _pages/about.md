Hello! I'm **Luyang Zhao**, a 5th year Ph.D. student from Dartmouth College specializing in Computer Science. I am fortunate to be under the guidance of Professor Devin Balkcom.

## Education & Experience

- Currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at **Dartmouth College**.
- Completed my undergraduate studies at **University of Minnesota**, where I had the opportunity to research under Professor Maria Gini. I proudly graduated with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics.

## Research Interests

My research covers a diverse range of topics including:
- Soft Robots
- Motion Planning
- Modular Robots
- Multi-robot Systems
- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- Machine Learning

I have recently delved into the design and analysis of **Soft Lattice Modules**, focusing on their independent and collective functionalities.

Some notable projects and research experiences include:
- Exploring localization, path planning, and navigation for **Amazon's autonomous mobility robots** during Summer 2020.
- Designing, building, and evaluating **memory-efficient data structures** to summarize the costs of crossing local regions for optimal pathfinding.
- Developing an **assistive device** for individuals with memory loss, incorporating SLAM with object detection.

# Recent Highlights

- **8/14**: Delighted to announce that my recent research work was spotlighted on Dartmouth College's [official website](https://home.dartmouth.edu/news/2023/08/computer-science-researcher-creates-flexible-robots).
- **6/6**: Honored to have tied for 2nd place in the **2023 Neukom Outstanding Graduate Research Prize**, receiving an award of $750.00.
- **5/12**: Thrilled to share that a paper I led has been accepted for publication in **RA-L** (Robotics and Automation Letters).
- **1/11**: Had the privilege of visiting **Yale University** to discuss collaborations and share insights.
