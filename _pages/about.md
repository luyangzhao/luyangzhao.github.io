<!-- 
Hello, I am Luyang Zhao, a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Dartmouth College, mentored by [**Professor Devin Balkcom**](https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/devin/). 
My research domain is diverse, encompassing **soft robots**, **modular robots**, **reinforcement learning**, **large language models (LLMs)**, **multi-robot systems**, **motion planning**, and **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**. My work integrates machine learning techniques with robotics design, application, and planning to develop adaptive, intelligent systems capable of complex behaviors and interactions in dynamic environments.



I earned double majors in Computer Science and Mathematics during my undergraduate years at the University of Minnesota, where I worked on research projects with [**Professor Maria Gini**](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~gini/).

Lately, I've been deeply involved in the design and analysis of **self-assembling soft modular robots**. For the terrestrial project, I am collaborating with [**Professor Kostas Bekris**](https://robotics.cs.rutgers.edu/pracsys/members/kostas-bekris/) from Rutgers University, [**Professor Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio**](https://www.eng.yale.edu/faboratory/) from Yale University, [**Professor Xiaonan Huang**](https://robotics.umich.edu/profile/xiaonan-sean-huang/) from the University of Michigan, and [**Professor Muhao Chen**](https://muhao-chen.github.io/) from the University of Kentucky. These robots have the unique capability to autonomously adapt and navigate across varied terrains, especially in challenging situations like crossing gaps, maneuvering over obstacles, and navigating through narrow passageways. Additionally, they can build active human-scale structures such as tents and scaffolding with the help of drones. 

My aquatic project is focused on building an aquatic platform for exploring locomotion, manipulation, and structure formation tasks, where I am using reinforcement learning to generate gaits for different configurations. This project is now collaborating with [**Professor Alberto Quattrini Li**](https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/albertoq/) from Dartmouth College, [**Professor Muhao Chen**](https://muhao-chen.github.io/) from the University of Kentucky and  [**Professor Haibo Dong**](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/haibo-dong) from the University of Virginia.

I am also investigating flexible, bio-inspired robotics, with a focus on designs like dolphin-inspired robots and morphing wings. Our research on morphing wings has been accepted by AIAA, and our work on the dolphin-inspired robot has been submitted to RoboSoft 2025.

I have also utilized **generative models, such as large language models (e.g., GPT)**, to design soft modular robots for various tasks. This work was done in collaboration with [**Professor Soroush Vosoughi**](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/) from Dartmouth College and [**Professor Bo Zhu**](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~bozhu/) from Georgia Tech.

In addition to these projects, I am also interested in theoretical motion planning problems, aiming to develop memory-efficient motion planning algorithms that maintain high-quality path-finding while minimizing resource usage.

I have co-organized workshops, including the **Tensegrity Robotics Workshop at IROS 2023**, and have mentored several graduate and undergraduate students. I have received the **Neukom Outstanding Graduate Research Prize** in 2023.


As a **reviewer**, I have evaluated papers for Journal **RA-L** and conferences like **ICRA**, **IROS**, **RoboSoft**, and **BioRob**. I have also completed research internships at **Amazon** and **TuSimple**, where I worked on projects related to localization, path planning, and autonomous vehicle optimization.
